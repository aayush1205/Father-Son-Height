# Father-Son-Height

In this project, we aim to predict a son's height if an input for the father's height is provided. We have implemented the algorithm from scratch, and have not used specific libraries to attain the purpose. The dataset is available at http://www.randomservices.org/random/data/Pearson.html. Octave was used to program the algorithm. The aim of this project was to apply the knowledge gained in univariate linear regression.
